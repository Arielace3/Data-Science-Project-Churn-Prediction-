# Data-Science-Project-Churn-Prediction-

A Mini-Project for SC1015 (Introduction to Data Science and Artificial Intelligence) which focuses on Sparkify from Udacity.

**Problem Definition**
- Are we able to predict if a paid user will churn based on the user's activity on the platform?
- Which model would be the best to predict it?

**Models Used**
- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest Classification

**Conclusion**
- Clustering allows us to understand the different behaviours of different segments of users which can help to target product intervention.
- Upsampling imbalanced data improved model performance especially on the minority class
- Logistic Regression did not perform well with non-linearly correlated variables
Yes, it is possible to predict if a user will churn with acceptable amount of accuracy and recall
